      <h2>HR-RS Index</h2>
      <p>
        Running Index is based on the linear relationship between heart rate and oxygen uptake â€“ when you run faster, your muscles need more oxygen to produce energy, so your your heart needs to pump blood faster and your heart rate goes up.
      </p>
      <h2>How running index works</h2>
      <p>
        We use your heart rate and pace during your run and your resting heart rate and maximal heart rate values to estimate your maximal aerobic running speed on a level ground. This speed estimate is then converted to an estimate of running VO2max, in other words your Running Index score.
